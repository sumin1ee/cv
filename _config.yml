        #   What started as a curiosity in path planning evolved into a deep passion for vision-centric AI and end-to-end learning systems
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            I initially joined the lab with a strong interest in path planning, where I explored the fundamentals of autonomous trajectory generation. Over time, my exposure to the full pipeline of autonomous systems‚Äîincluding sensor integration, camera-LiDAR setups, and vision-based perception‚Äîsparked a growing curiosity in computer vision. This interdisciplinary perspective led me to dive deeper into multi-modal fusion and eventually shaped my passion for vision-centric planning. Recently, I‚Äôve become especially drawn to end-to-end planning systems, where perception and decision-making are learned jointly, and I'm actively pursuing research in that direction.
